# Challenges
# Rewards and required items have to be described using Bukkit Materials
# and be exactly correct
# Do not use Type Id's - they will not work
# Challenges can be one of three types - inventory, island or level.
# inventory - means the player must have the items on them
# island - means the items have to be on the island and within 10 blocks of the player
#
# Challenges can be repeatable only if they are inventory challenges
# permissions can be given as a reward
#
# You can use color code;
#
# Reward Commands - commands can be run when a challenge is completed and repeated
# Commands are:
#    rewardcommands:
#      - command1
#      - command2
#    repeatrewardcommands:
#      - command1
#      - command2      
# The commands are listed and run in order. Do not put a / in front of the command.
# The token [player] will be replaced with the player's name.
# Example:
#    rewardcommands:
#      - pex promote [player]
#      - heal [player]
#      - warp winner_circle [player]
# If a command fails, it will be noted in the console.
#

#
# Format POTION:NAME:<LEVEL>:<EXTENDED>:<SPLASH/LINGER>:QTY
